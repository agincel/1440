# 1440
There are 1440 minutes in a day -- this 24/7 convenience store lies in a strip mall right next to a major Californian highway leading to the city of San Alejandro. As people come through the store, the store's TV reports on mounting tensions with a foreign nation. While the populace is generally dismissive of such threats after many years of hearing them over and over again, the world will be shocked when San Alejandro is attacked. How will the communities in and around the city react? What is a small convenience store owner to do faced with tragedy and horror?

1440 was designed and developed as a part of HAR494: Game Development for Civil Defense, a seminar course taught at Stevens Institute of Technology under Professors Alex Wellerstein and Nicholas O'Brien.
